# [890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-and-replace-pattern/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`, return *a list of* `words[i]` *that match* `pattern`. You may return the answer in **any order**.
A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word.
Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}.
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= pattern.length <= 20`
- `1 <= words.length <= 50`
- `words[i].length == pattern.length`
- `pattern` and `words[i]` are lowercase English letters.


## Solutions

### O(n * m) of solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        def is_match(word, pattern):
            word_to_pattern = {}
            pattern_to_word = {}
            for char_word, char_pattern in zip(word, pattern):
                if char_word not in word_to_pattern and char_pattern not in pattern_to_word:
                    word_to_pattern[char_word] = char_pattern
                    pattern_to_word[char_pattern] = char_word
                if (char_word in word_to_pattern and word_to_pattern[char_word] != char_pattern) or \
                   (char_pattern in pattern_to_word and pattern_to_word[char_pattern] != char_word):
                    return False
            return True

        answer = []
        for word in words:
            if is_match(word, pattern):
                answer.append(word)
        return answer
```

The solution involves checking each word in the `words` list to determine if it matches the given pattern. To do this, we'll define a helper function, `is_match(word, pattern)`, that checks if a given `word` matches the `pattern`.

Here's how the solution works:

1. Define the `is_match(word, pattern)` function that takes a word and a pattern as input. Within this function, initialize two dictionaries, `word_to_pattern` and `pattern_to_word`, which will store the mapping of characters from the word to the pattern and vice versa.
2. Iterate through each character pair, `(char_word, char_pattern)`, where `char_word` is a character from the word and `char_pattern` is a character from the pattern. For each character pair, perform the following steps:
   - If `char_word` is not in the `word_to_pattern` dictionary and `char_pattern` is not in the `pattern_to_word` dictionary, this means that the mapping of `char_word` to `char_pattern` and `char_pattern` to `char_word` has not been established yet. In this case, add `char_word` to `word_to_pattern` with a value of `char_pattern` and add `char_pattern` to `pattern_to_word` with a value of `char_word`.
   - If `char_word` is already in the `word_to_pattern` dictionary, check if the value associated with `char_word` is equal to `char_pattern`. If they are not equal, return `False` because the mapping is not consistent.
   - If `char_pattern` is already in the `pattern_to_word` dictionary, check if the value associated with `char_pattern` is equal to `char_word`. If they are not equal, return `False` because the mapping is not consistent.
3. After iterating through all character pairs, if no inconsistencies are found in the mappings, return `True` from the `is_match` function, indicating that the word matches the pattern.
4. In the main part of the solution, initialize an empty list `answer` to store the words that match the pattern.
5. Iterate through each word in the `words` list. For each word, call the `is_match` function with the word and the pattern as arguments. If the function returns `True`, append the word to the `answer` list.
6. After iterating through all words, the `answer` list contains the words that match the pattern. Return the `answer` list as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through the `words` list once and performs checks for each character pair in the word and pattern, leading to a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the pattern.
- Space Complexity: The solution uses additional space to store the dictionaries `word_to_pattern` and `pattern_to_word`, which can have a maximum of 26 lowercase letters as keys and values. Therefore, the space complexity is O(26) ≈ O(1), as it is a constant amount of space.

#### Summary

The provided solution effectively checks each word in the `words` list to determine if it matches the given `pattern` by establishing mappings between characters. It has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.

### Another O(n * m) of solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def findAndReplacePattern(self, words: List[str], pattern: str) -> List[str]:
        def to_num_array(word):
            mapping = {}
            return [mapping.setdefault(char, len(mapping)) for char in word]

        numeric_pattern = to_num_array(pattern)
        answer = []
        for word in words:
            if numeric_pattern == to_num_array(word):
                answer.append(word)
        return answer
```

The solution involves checking each word in the `words` list to determine if it matches the given pattern. To do this, we'll define a helper function, `to_num_array(word)`, that converts a word into a numeric array based on character mapping. This function will map each character in the word to a unique numeric value, maintaining the order of characters.

Here's how the solution works:

1. Define the `to_num_array(word)` function that takes a word as input. Within this function, initialize an empty dictionary called `mapping`. This dictionary will be used to map characters to their corresponding numeric values. Then, iterate through each character, `char`, in the word and perform the following steps:
   - Check if `char` exists as a key in the `mapping` dictionary. If it does, return the corresponding numeric value using `mapping[char]`. If it does not exist, add `char` as a key to the `mapping` dictionary with a value equal to `len(mapping)`. This assigns a unique numeric value to each character in the order they appear.
   - Finally, return a list of numeric values obtained from the mapping for each character in the word. This list represents the numeric array corresponding to the given word.
2. In the main part of the solution, initialize an empty list `answer` to store the words that match the pattern.
3. Use the `to_num_array` function to convert the pattern string into a numeric array called `numeric_pattern`.
4. Iterate through each word in the `words` list. For each word, convert it into a numeric array using the `to_num_array` function and store it in a variable called `numeric_word`.
5. Check if `numeric_pattern` is equal to `numeric_word`. If they are equal, it means the word matches the pattern. In this case, append the original word to the `answer` list.
6. After iterating through all words, the `answer` list contains the words that match the pattern. Return the `answer` list as the final result.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through each word in the `words` list and converts each word into a numeric array using the `to_num_array` function. The conversion takes O(m) time for each word, where m is the length of the word. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the pattern.

- Space Complexity: The solution uses additional space to store the `mapping` dictionary, which can have at most 26 lowercase letters as keys and values. Therefore, the space complexity is O(26) ≈ O(1), as it is a constant amount of space. Additionally, the numeric arrays have a space complexity of O(m), where m is the length of the pattern. Overall, the space complexity is O(1).

#### Summary

The provided solution effectively checks each word in the `words` list to determine if it matches the given `pattern` by converting both the pattern and the words into numeric arrays based on character mapping. It has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.
