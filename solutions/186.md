# [1630. Arithmetic Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/arithmetic-subarrays/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

A sequence of numbers is called **arithmetic** if it consists of at least two elements, and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same. More formally, a sequence `s` is arithmetic if and only if `s[i+1] - s[i] == s[1] - s[0]` for all valid `i`.

For example, these are **arithmetic** sequences:

```
1, 3, 5, 7, 9
7, 7, 7, 7
3, -1, -5, -9
```

The following sequence is not **arithmetic**:

```
1, 1, 2, 5, 7
```

You are given an array of `n` integers, `nums`, and two arrays of `m` integers each, `l` and `r`, representing the `m` range queries, where the `ith` query is the range `[l[i], r[i]]`. All the arrays are **0-indexed**.

Return *a list of* `boolean` *elements* `answer`*, where* `answer[i]` *is* `true` *if the subarray* `nums[l[i]], nums[l[i]+1], ... , nums[r[i]]` *can be **rearranged** to form an **arithmetic** sequence, and* `false` *otherwise.*


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums =[4,6,5,9,3,7], l =[0,0,2], r =[2,3,5]Output:[true,false,true]Explanation:
In the 0th query, the subarray is [4,6,5]. This can be rearranged as [6,5,4], which is an arithmetic sequence.
In the 1st query, the subarray is [4,6,5,9]. This cannot be rearranged as an arithmetic sequence.
In the 2nd query, the subarray is[5,9,3,7]. This can be rearranged as[3,5,7,9], which is an arithmetic sequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-12,-9,-3,-12,-6,15,20,-25,-20,-15,-10], l = [0,1,6,4,8,7], r = [4,4,9,7,9,10]
Output: [false,true,false,false,true,true]
```


## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `m == l.length`
- `m == r.length`
- `2 <= n <= 500`
- `1 <= m <= 500`
- `0 <= l[i] < r[i] < n`
- `105 <= nums[i] <= 105`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

**Python3**

```python3
class Solution:
    def checkArithmeticSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], l: List[int], r: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        answer = []
        for start, end in zip(l, r):
            sequence = sorted(nums[start: end+1])
            diff = sequence[1] - sequence[0]

            is_arithmetic = True
            for i in range(1, len(sequence)):
                if sequence[i] - sequence[i-1] != diff:
                    is_arithmetic = False
                    break
            answer.append(is_arithmetic)
        return answer
```

The provided solution iterates through each range query defined by the `l` and `r` arrays and checks if the subarray within that range can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

1. Initialize an empty list `answer` to store the boolean results for each query.

2. Iterate through each range query using a loop variable `i` from 0 to `m-1`, where `m` is the number of queries.
   - For each query `i`, extract the subarray defined by the range `[l[i], r[i]]` from the `nums` array and store it in the `sequence` variable.

3. Sort the `sequence` subarray in ascending order. Sorting is performed to ensure that the elements are in non-decreasing order, which is a necessary condition for forming an arithmetic sequence.

4. Calculate the common difference `diff` by subtracting the second element from the first element in the sorted `sequence`.

5. Initialize a boolean variable `is_arithmetic` to `True`, indicating that the subarray is assumed to be an arithmetic sequence.

6. Iterate through the sorted `sequence` starting from the second element (index 1) using a loop variable `i`. For each element at index `i`, check if the difference between the current element and the previous element (at index `i-1`) is equal to the calculated `diff`. If the difference is not equal to `diff`, set `is_arithmetic` to `False` and break out of the loop.

7. After checking all elements in the `sequence`, append the value of `is_arithmetic` to the `answer` list for the current query.

8. Repeat steps 2 to 7 for all range queries.

9. Return the `answer` list containing boolean values for each query.

#### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: The solution iterates through each range query and sorts the subarray for each query. Sorting has a time complexity of O(k * log(k)), where k is the length of the subarray. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m * k * log(k)), where m is the number of queries and k is the average length of subarrays.

- Space Complexity: The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, and the space required for the `answer` list is O(m) to store the boolean results. Overall, the space complexity is O(m).

#### Summary

The provided solution efficiently checks whether subarrays of the given `nums` array can be rearranged to form arithmetic sequences. It iterates through each range query, sorts the subarray, calculates the common difference, and checks if the elements satisfy the conditions of an arithmetic sequence. The boolean results are stored in the `answer` list and returned as the final result.
