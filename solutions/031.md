# [1486. XOR Operation in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/xor-operation-in-an-array/)**

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given an integer `n` and an integer `start`.
Define an array `nums` where `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (**0-indexed**) and `n == nums.length`.
Return *the bitwise XOR of all elements of* `nums`.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 6 ^ 8) = 8.
Where "^" corresponds to bitwise XOR operator.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, start = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [3, 5, 7, 9] where (3 ^ 5 ^ 7 ^ 9) = 8.

```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= start <= 1000`
- `n == nums.length`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def xorOperation(self, n: int, start: int) -> int:
        result = start
        for i in range(1, n):
            result ^= start + 2 * i
        return result
```

The given solution calculates the bitwise XOR of the elements in the `nums` array by iteratively performing XOR operations.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a variable `result` with the value of `start`. This variable will store the cumulative XOR of the elements.
2. Iterate through the range from 1 to `n`, representing the indices of the `nums` array.
   - Calculate the value of `nums[i]` as `start + 2 * i`.
   - Perform a bitwise XOR operation between `result` and `nums[i]`, and update `result` with the XOR result.
3. Return the value of `result`, which represents the bitwise XOR of all the elements in the `nums` array.

The algorithm calculates the XOR of each element in the `nums` array and updates the cumulative XOR result stored in the `result` variable.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the value of `n`. The algorithm iterates through the range from 1 to `n` and performs a constant-time XOR operation at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the `result` variable.

#### Summary

The given solution calculates the bitwise XOR of the elements in the `nums` array based on the given `n` and `start` values. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
