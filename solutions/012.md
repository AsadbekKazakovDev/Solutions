# [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

**Difficulty:**  :yellow_circle: Medium

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added 
together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27`
is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is 
written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making 
four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.
There are six instances where subtraction is used:

`I` can be placed before `V` (`5`) and `X` (`10`) to make `4` and `9`. 
`X` can be placed before `L` (`50`) and `C` (`100`) to make `40` and `90`. 
`C` can be placed before `D` (`500`) and `M` (`1000`) to make `400` and `900`.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
Explanation: 3 is represented as 3 ones.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= num <= 3999`


## Solutions

### O(1) solution

#### Python3
```python3
def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        mapping = {
            1000: “M”,
            900: “CM”,
            500: “D”,
            400: “CD”,
            100: “C”,
            90: “XC”,
            50: “L”,
            40: “XL”, 
            10: “X”, 
            9: “IX”,
            5: “V”, 
            4: “IV”, 
            1: “I”
        }
        result = []
        for key in sorted(mapping.keys(), reverse=True):
            if key <= num:
                result.append(mapping[key] * (num // key))
                num %= key
        return “”.join(result)
```

The given solution solves the problem by performing the following steps:
1. Create a mapping that maps each numeral value to its corresponding Roman numeral representation. The mapping contains the base values and the special cases where subtraction is used.
2. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the Roman numeral representation of the number.
3. Iterate through the keys of the mapping in descending order.
   - Check if the current key is less than or equal to `num`.
     - If true, append the Roman numeral representation of the current key to `result` repeated `num // key` times.
     - Update `num` by taking the modulus of `num` with the current key.
4. Finally, join the elements of `result` into a single string and return it as the Roman numeral representation of the given number.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because the maximum number of iterations in the loop is constant. The loop iterates through the keys of the mapping, which is a fixed-size set of values.

The space complexity of the algorithm is also O(1) because the size of the output string is bounded by the given constraints.

#### Summary

The given solution converts an integer `num` into its Roman numeral representation. It uses a mapping of base values and special cases to construct the Roman numeral representation. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(1) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.
