# [189. Rotate Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/description/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given an integer array `nums`, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

## Follow up:

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least 
**three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?


## Solutions

### O(n) solution without extra space in Python3 and Java

** Example **
```text
k = 3 nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 target: 3
[4, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 7]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 target: 6
[7, 2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 target: 2
[3, 2, 7, 1, 5, 6, 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 target: 5
[6, 2, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 target: 1
[2, 6, 7, 1, 5, 3, 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 target: 4
[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source: 0 source: 0
[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        length = len(nums)
        source, target = 0, 0
        for _ in range(length):
            target = (target + k) % length
            if source == target:
                source += 1
                target += 1 
            else: 
                nums[target], nums[source] = nums[source], nums[target]
```

#### Java
```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int length = nums.length;
        int source = 0;
        int target = 0;

        for(int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            target = (target + k) % length;
            if (source == target) {
                source++;
                target++;
            } else {
                int temp = nums[target];
                nums[target] = nums[source];
                nums[source] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The given solution solves the problem by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `length` to store the length of the array `nums`.
2. Initialize two variables `source` and `target` to keep track of the indices while swapping elements.
3. Iterate `length` number of times:
   - Calculate the new `target` index by adding `k` to the current `target` index and taking the modulo `length`.
   - Check if `source` is equal to `target`. If they are equal, increment both `source` and `target` by 1 to move to the next element.
   - Otherwise, swap the elements at indices `source` and `target` in the array `nums`.
4. After the iteration, the array `nums` will be rotated to the right by `k` steps.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is because the algorithm performs a single pass through the array to swap the elements.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it does not use any additional data structures that grow with the input size. The modifications are done in-place, so the memory usage remains constant regardless of the input size.

#### Summary

The given solution effectively rotates the array `nums` to the right by `k` steps in-place. It achieves this by swapping the elements using two pointers, `source` and `target`, and performing a single pass through the array. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem.
