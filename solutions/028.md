# [2161. Partition Array According to Given Pivot](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-according-to-given-pivot/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy| :yellow_circle: Medium| :red_circle: Hard

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. 
Rearrange `nums` such that the following conditions are satisfied:

- Every element less than `pivot` appears **before** every element greater 
than `pivot`.
- Every element equal to `pivot` appears **in between** the elements less 
than and greater than `pivot`.
- The **relative order** of the elements less than `pivot` and the elements 
greater than `pivot` is maintained.
- More formally, consider every `pi`, `pj` where `pi` is the new position 
of the `ith` element and `pj` is the new position of the `jth` element. For 
elements less than `pivot`, if `i < j` and `nums[i] < pivot` and 
`nums[j] < pivot`, then `pi < pj`. Similarly for elements greater than 
`pivot`, if `i < j` and `nums[i] > pivot` and `nums[j] > pivot`, then `pi < pj`.

Return `nums` *after the rearrangement.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [9,12,5,10,14,3,10], pivot = 10
Output: [9,5,3,10,10,12,14]
Explanation: 
The elements 9, 5, and 3 are less than the pivot so they are on the left side of the array.
The elements 12 and 14 are greater than the pivot so they are on the right side of the array.
The relative ordering of the elements less than and greater than pivot is also maintained. [9, 5, 3] and [12, 14] are the respective orderings.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [-3,4,3,2], pivot = 2
Output: [-3,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
The element -3 is less than the pivot so it is on the left side of the array.
The elements 4 and 3 are greater than the pivot so they are on the right side of the array.
The relative ordering of the elements less than and greater than pivot is also maintained. [-3] and [4, 3] are the respective orderings.

```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`
- `pivot` equals to an element of `nums`.

## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def pivotArray(self, nums: List[int], pivot: int) -> List[int]:
        less, great = [], []
        equal_count = 0
        for n in nums:
            if n < pivot:
                less.append(n)
            elif n > pivot:
                great.append(n)
            else:
                equal_count += 1

        return less+[pivot]*equal_count+great
```

The given solution rearranges the `nums` array based on the `pivot` value by dividing it into three parts: elements less than `pivot`, elements equal to `pivot`, and elements greater than `pivot`.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize two empty lists: `less` to store elements less than `pivot`, and `great` to store elements greater than `pivot`.
2. Initialize a variable `equal_count` to keep track of the count of elements equal to `pivot`.
3. Iterate through each element `n` in the `nums` array.
   - If `n` is less than `pivot`, append it to the `less` list.
   - If `n` is greater than `pivot`, append it to the `great` list.
   - If `n` is equal to `pivot`, increment the `equal_count`.
4. Return the concatenation of the `less` list, `equal_count` number of `pivot` elements, and the `great` list.

The algorithm partitions the `nums` array into three parts: elements less than `pivot`, elements equal to `pivot`, and elements greater than `pivot`. It then returns the rearranged array that satisfies the given conditions.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates through each element of `nums` once and performs constant-time operations.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), as it uses additional space to store the `less` and `great` lists. The space required is proportional to the length of `nums`.

#### Summary

The given solution rearranges the `nums` array based on the `pivot` value by dividing it into three parts: elements less than `pivot`, elements equal to `pivot`, and elements greater than `pivot`. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
