# [1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://leetcode.com/problems/widest-vertical-area-between-two-points-containing-no-points/description/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

Given `n` `points` on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, Return *the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area.*

A **vertical area** is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite height). The **widest vertical area** is the one with the maximum width.

Note that points **on the edge** of a vertical area **are not** considered included in the area.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

![https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/19/points3.png)

```
Input: points = [[8,7],[9,9],[7,4],[9,7]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Both the red and the blue area are optimal.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[3,1],[9,0],[1,0],[1,4],[5,3],[8,8]]
Output: 3

```

## Constraints:

- `n == points.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 109`


## Solutions

### O(n\*log(n)) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def maxWidthOfVerticalArea(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points = sorted(points, key=lambda point: point[0])
        maximum = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points)):
            maximum = max(points[i][0]-points[i-1][0], maximum)
        return maximum
```

The given solution finds the widest vertical area between two points by sorting the points based on their x-coordinates and iterating through the sorted list to calculate the maximum width.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Sort the points array in ascending order based on the x-coordinate using the `sorted()` function and a lambda function.
2. Initialize a variable, `maximum`, to 0, which will store the maximum width of the vertical area.
3. Iterate through the sorted points array from index 1 to the end.
   - Calculate the width between the current point and the previous point by subtracting the x-coordinate of the previous point from the x-coordinate of the current point.
   - Update `maximum` with the maximum value between the calculated width and the current `maximum`.
4. Return the `maximum` value, which represents the widest vertical area between two points.

The algorithm finds the widest vertical area by calculating the width between adjacent points and keeping track of the maximum width.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n log n), where n is the number of points. The algorithm performs a sorting operation on the points array, which has a time complexity of O(n log n). The subsequent iteration through the sorted array has a linear time complexity of O(n).

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space to store the sorted points array.

#### Summary

The given solution finds the widest vertical area between two points on a 2D plane by sorting the points array based on their x-coordinates and calculating the maximum width. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
