# [1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-consistent-strings/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of **distinct** characters and an 
array of strings `words`. A string is **consistent** if all characters in 
the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return *the number of **consistent** strings in the array* `words`.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 104`
- `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- The characters in `allowed` are **distinct**.
- `words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution using set in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count, char_set = 0, set(allowed)
        for word in words:
            if len(set(word).difference(char_set)) == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
```

The given solution counts the number of consistent strings by iterating through the `words` array and checking if each word is consistent.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a count variable to 0 to keep track of the number of consistent strings.
2. Create a character set, `char_set`, from the `allowed` string using the `set` function.
3. Iterate through each word in the `words` array:
   - Check if the difference between the characters in the current word and the `char_set` is an empty set. If it is, it means all characters in the word are present in the `allowed` string, making it consistent. Increment the count by 1.
4. Return the count, which represents the number of consistent strings.

The algorithm checks each word in the `words` array to see if all its characters are present in the `allowed` string, and increments the count accordingly.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * m), where n is the length of the `words` array and m is the maximum length of a word in the `words` array. The algorithm iterates through each word in the `words` array and performs a set difference operation, which takes O(m) time, for each word.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(k), where k is the length of the `allowed` string. The algorithm creates a `char_set` set containing the characters from the `allowed` string, which takes O(k) space.

#### Summary

The given solution counts the number of consistent strings in the `words` array by checking if each word has all its characters present in the `allowed` string. It has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(k), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.

### O(n) solution using fixed length array in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def _get_counter(self, allowed: str) -> List[int]:
        counter = [0] * 26
        for char in allowed:
            counter[ord(char)-ord('a')] += 1
        return counter

    def _counter_difference(self, a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i, count in enumerate(a):
            if count > 0:
                b[i] = 0
        return b

    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count, allowed_counter = 0, self._get_counter(allowed)
        for word in words:
            word_counter = self._get_counter(word)
            if sum(self._counter_difference(allowed_counter, word_counter)) == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
```

The given solution uses a counter-based approach to determine the number of consistent strings in the `words` array.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Define a private helper method, `_get_counter()`, which takes a string `allowed` as input and returns a list representing the count of each character in the string. The list has a length of 26, initialized with zeros.
   - Iterate through each character in the `allowed` string.
   - Increment the count for the corresponding character in the counter list by 1.
   - Return the counter list.
2. Define another private helper method, `_counter_difference()`, which takes two counter lists `a` and `b` as input and modifies `b` to represent the difference between `a` and `b`.
   - Iterate through each index and count in the `a` list.
   - If the count in `a` is greater than 0, set the count in `b` to 0.
   - Return the modified `b` list.
3. Define the main method, `countConsistentStrings()`, which takes the `allowed` string and the `words` array as input and returns the number of consistent strings in the `words` array.
   - Initialize a count variable to 0.
   - Obtain the counter list for the `allowed` string using the `_get_counter()` method.
   - Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
     - Obtain the counter list for the current word using the `_get_counter()` method.
     - Calculate the difference between the `allowed` counter and the current word counter using the `_counter_difference()` method.
     - If the sum of the modified counter list is 0, increment the count variable by 1.
   - Return the count variable.

The algorithm uses counter lists to track the counts of characters in the `allowed` string and words from the `words` array. It calculates the difference between the `allowed` counter and the word counter and determines if the word is consistent by checking if the sum of the modified counter is 0.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm depends on the length of the `words` array and the length of each word. Let `n` be the length of the `words` array and `m` be the maximum length of a word. The algorithm iterates through each word in the `words` array and each character in the word, performing constant-time operations at each iteration. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * m). Since `m` is fixed final result will be O(n).

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the counter lists and the count variable.

#### Summary

The given solution determines the number of consistent strings in the `words` array by using counter lists to track the counts of characters in the `allowed` string and words. It has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
