# [1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-consistent-strings/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of **distinct** characters and an 
array of strings `words`. A string is **consistent** if all characters in 
the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return *the number of **consistent** strings in the array* `words`.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2
Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7
Explanation: All strings are consistent.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4
Explanation: Strings "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent.

```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= words.length <= 104`
- `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- The characters in `allowed` are **distinct**.
- `words[i]` and `allowed` contain only lowercase English letters.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution using set in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count, char_set = 0, set(allowed)
        for word in words:
            if len(set(word).difference(char_set)) == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
```

The given solution counts the number of consistent strings by iterating through the `words` array and checking if each word is consistent.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a count variable to 0 to keep track of the number of consistent strings.
2. Create a character set, `char_set`, from the `allowed` string using the `set` function.
3. Iterate through each word in the `words` array:
   - Check if the difference between the characters in the current word and the `char_set` is an empty set. If it is, it means all characters in the word are present in the `allowed` string, making it consistent. Increment the count by 1.
4. Return the count, which represents the number of consistent strings.

The algorithm checks each word in the `words` array to see if all its characters are present in the `allowed` string, and increments the count accordingly.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * m), where n is the length of the `words` array and m is the maximum length of a word in the `words` array. The algorithm iterates through each word in the `words` array and performs a set difference operation, which takes O(m) time, for each word.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(k), where k is the length of the `allowed` string. The algorithm creates a `char_set` set containing the characters from the `allowed` string, which takes O(k) space.

#### Summary

The given solution counts the number of consistent strings in the `words` array by checking if each word has all its characters present in the `allowed` string. It has a time complexity of O(n * m) and a space complexity of O(k), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.

### O(n) solution using fixed length array

The provided algorithm aims to count the number of strings in the `words` list that consist only of characters from the `allowed` string. Here's an analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity, considering the given constraints:

1. **Helper Function `_get_counter`**: This function creates a counter list to store the count of each lowercase English letter in the `allowed` string. It iterates over the characters in the `allowed` string, which has a maximum length of 26, and increments the count in the corresponding index of the counter list. The time complexity of this function is O(1) because the length of the `allowed` string is fixed at 26.

2. **Helper Function `_counter_difference`**: This function calculates the difference between two counter lists by setting the corresponding elements of `b` to zero for every non-zero count in `a`. The function iterates over the elements of `a`, which has a fixed length of 26, and updates the elements of `b`. Hence, the time complexity of this function is O(1).

3. **Counting Consistent Strings**: The algorithm iterates over each string `word` in the `words` list. For each `word`, it creates a counter list using the `_get_counter` function, which has a time complexity of O(1). It then calculates the difference between the `allowed_counter` and `word_counter` using the `_counter_difference` function, which also has a time complexity of O(1). Finally, it sums the resulting counter list and checks if the sum is zero to determine if all characters in `word` are present in `allowed`. The sum operation and the comparison both take constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity of this step is O(1).

4. **Returning Count**: Finally, the algorithm returns the value of `count`, which requires constant time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm remains O(n), where n is the number of words in the list.

In terms of space complexity, the algorithm utilizes additional memory for the `allowed_counter` and `word_counter` lists, both of which have a fixed length of 26. Hence, the space complexity is O(1).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity, where n is the number of words in the list.
- Space complexity: O(1) - Constant space complexity.

The algorithm efficiently checks each word in the `words` list to determine if it consists only of characters present in the `allowed` string. It utilizes counter lists to store the counts of characters and calculates their differences. The algorithm's performance remains constant regardless of the lengths of the words or the number of characters in the `allowed` string, given the provided constraints.

#### Python3
```python3
class Solution:
    def _get_counter(self, allowed: str) -> List[int]:
        counter = [0] * 26
        for char in allowed:
            counter[ord(char)-ord('a')] += 1
        return counter

    def _counter_difference(self, a: List[int], b: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i, count in enumerate(a):
            if count > 0:
                b[i] = 0
        return b

    def countConsistentStrings(self, allowed: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        count, allowed_counter = 0, self._get_counter(allowed)
        for word in words:
            word_counter = self._get_counter(word)
            if sum(self._counter_difference(allowed_counter, word_counter)) == 0:
                count += 1
        return count
```
