# [1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-move-all-balls-to-each-box/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You have `n` boxes. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where 
`boxes[i]` is `'0'` if the i<sup>th</sup> box is empty, and `'1'` if it 
contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move **one** ball from a box to an adjacent box. Box
`i` is adjacent to box `j` if `abs(i - j) == 1`. Note that after doing so, 
there may be more than one ball in some boxes.

Return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the **minimum** 
number of operations needed to move all the balls to the i<sup>th</sup> box.

Each `answer[i]` is calculated considering the **initial** state of the boxes.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: boxes = "110"
Output: [1,1,3]
Explanation: The answer for each box is as follows:
1) First box: you will have to move one ball from the second box to the first box in one operation.
2) Second box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the second box in one operation.
3) Third box: you will have to move one ball from the first box to the third box in two operations, and move one ball from the second box to the third box in one operation.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: boxes = "001011"
Output: [11,8,5,4,3,4]
```

## Constraints:

- `n == boxes.length` 
- `1 <= n <= 2000` 
- `boxes[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.


## Solutions

### O(n^2) solution in Python3 (Naive approach)
```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, boxes: str) -> List[int]:
        length = len(boxes)
        result = []
        for i in range(length):
            count = 0
            for j in range(length):
                if i == j:
                    continue
                count += abs(j-i) * (1 if boxes[j] == "1" else 0)
            result.append(count)
        return result
```

The given solution calculates the minimum number of operations for each box by iterating through each box and counting the number of operations required to move all the balls to that box.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize an empty array `result` to store the minimum number of operations for each box.
2. Iterate through each box from left to right using the index `i`.
   - Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of operations.
   - Iterate through each box from left to right using the index `j`.
     - If `i` is equal to `j`, skip the current iteration.
     - Calculate the distance between `i` and `j` using `abs(j-i)`.
     - If the box at index `j` contains a ball ('1'), increment the `count` by the calculated distance.
   - Append the `count` to the `result` array.
3. Return the `result` array, which contains the minimum number of operations for each box.

The algorithm calculates the minimum number of operations for each box by iterating through each box and counting the number of operations required to move all the balls to that box. It skips the current box during the inner loop and increments the count by the distance between the current and inner boxes if the inner box contains a ball.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the `boxes` string. The algorithm has a nested loop structure where it iterates through each box for each box, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space to store the `result` array, which has the same length as `boxes`.

#### Summary

The given solution calculates the minimum number of operations for each box by iterating through each box and counting the number of operations required to move all the balls to that box. It has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
