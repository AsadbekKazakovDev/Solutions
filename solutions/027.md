# [2574. Left and Right Sum Differences](https://leetcode.com/problems/left-and-right-sum-differences/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a **0-indexed** integer array 
`answer` where:

- `answer.length == nums.length.`
- `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|.`

Where:

- `leftSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the left of the index `i` in the 
array `nums`. If there is no such element, `leftSum[i] = 0`.
- `rightSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the right of the index `i` in the
array `nums`. If there is no such element, `rightSum[i] = 0`.
Return the array `answer`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [10,4,8,3]
Output: [15,1,11,22]
Explanation: The array leftSum is [0,10,14,22] and the array rightSum is [15,11,3,0].
The array answer is [|0 - 15|,|10 - 11|,|14 - 3|,|22 - 0|] = [15,1,11,22].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [0]
Explanation: The array leftSum is [0] and the array rightSum is [0].
The array answer is [|0 - 0|] = [0].
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def leftRightDifference(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        right, left_sum, answer = 0, sum(nums), []
        for num in nums:
            right += num
            answer.append(abs(right-left_sum))
            left_sum -= num
        return answer
```

The given solution calculates the array `answer` by iteratively summing the elements from left to right and calculating the difference between the left and right sums at each index.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize the variables `right` to 0, `left_sum` to the sum of all elements in `nums`, and an empty array `answer` to store the results.
2. Iterate through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - Add `num` to the `right` sum.
   - Calculate the absolute difference between `right` and `left_sum` and append it to the `answer` array.
   - Subtract `num` from the `left_sum`.
3. Return the `answer` array, which contains the absolute differences between the left and right sums at each index.

The algorithm calculates the left sum by subtracting the current element from the total sum and adds the current element to the right sum. It then calculates the absolute difference between the left and right sums and appends it to the `answer` array.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates through each element of `nums` once and performs constant-time operations.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space to store the `answer` array, which has the same length as `nums`.

#### Summary

The given solution calculates the array `answer` by iteratively summing the elements from left to right and calculating the difference between the left and right sums at each index. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
