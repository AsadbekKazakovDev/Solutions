# [2433. Find The Original Array of Prefix Xor](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-original-array-of-prefix-xor/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given an **integer** array `pref` of size `n`. Find and return *the array* `arr` *of size* `n` *that satisfies*:

- `pref[i] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[i]`.

Note that `^` denotes the **bitwise-xor** operation.

It can be proven that the answer is **unique**.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pref = [5,2,0,3,1]
Output: [5,7,2,3,2]
Explanation: From the array [5,7,2,3,2] we have the following:
- pref[0] = 5.
- pref[1] = 5 ^ 7 = 2.
- pref[2] = 5 ^ 7 ^ 2 = 0.
- pref[3] = 5 ^ 7 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 3.
- pref[4] = 5 ^ 7 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 2 = 1.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: pref = [13]
Output: [13]
Explanation: We have pref[0] = arr[0] = 13.

```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= pref.length <= 105`
- `0 <= pref[i] <= 106`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def findArray(self, pref: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        answer= [pref[0]]
        for i in range(len(pref)-1):
            answer.append(pref[i]^pref[i+1])

        return answer
```

The given solution constructs the array `arr` based on the given `pref` array by performing the bitwise XOR operation between adjacent elements.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize an empty array `answer` with the first element of `pref` as the first element of `answer`.
2. Iterate through the range from 0 to the length of `pref` minus 1:
   - Calculate the XOR of the current element in `pref` and the next element in `pref`.
   - Append the result of the XOR operation to the `answer` array.
3. Return the `answer` array, which represents the array `arr` that satisfies the given condition.

The algorithm constructs the `answer` array by performing the bitwise XOR operation between adjacent elements of the `pref` array.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the size of the `pref` array. The algorithm iterates through the `pref` array once and performs a constant-time XOR operation at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it creates a new array, `answer`, to store the elements of `arr`.

#### Summary

The given solution constructs the array `arr` based on the given `pref` array by performing the bitwise XOR operation between adjacent elements. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
