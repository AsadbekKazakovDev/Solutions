# [2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-an-array-into-a-2d-array-with-conditions/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to create a 2D array from `nums`
satisfying the following conditions:

- The 2D array should contain **only** the elements of the array `nums`.
- Each row in the 2D array contains **distinct** integers.
- The number of rows in the 2D array should be **minimal**.

Return the __resulting array__. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Note** that the 2D array can have a different number of elements on each row.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1]
Output: [[1,3,4,2],[1,3],[1]]
Explanation: We can create a 2D array that contains the following rows:
- 1,3,4,2
- 1,3
- 1
All elements of nums were used, and each row of the 2D array contains distinct integers, so it is a valid answer.
It can be shown that we cannot have less than 3 rows in a valid array.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [[4,3,2,1]]
Explanation: All elements of the array are distinct, so we can keep all of them in the first row of the 2D array.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= nums.length`


## Solutions

### O(n^2) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def findMatrix(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        counter = Counter(nums)

        result = []
        for _ in range(max(counter.values())):
            array = []
            for num in counter.keys():
                if counter[num] > 0:
                    array.append(num)
                    counter[num] -= 1
            result.append(array)
        return result
```

The given solution uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the `nums` array. It then creates a 2D array by iteratively selecting distinct numbers from the counter until all occurrences of each number have been used.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Create a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the `nums` array.
2. Initialize an empty result list to store the rows of the 2D array.
3. Iterate until all occurrences of each number have been used:
   - Create an empty array to represent a row in the 2D array.
   - Iterate through each distinct number in the counter:
     - If the counter value for the number is greater than 0, append the number to the row array and decrement the counter value by 1.
   - Append the row array to the result list.
4. Return the resulting 2D array.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates over the counter and builds the rows of the 2D array.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm uses additional space to store the counter and the resulting 2D array.

#### Summary

The given solution constructs a 2D array from the `nums` array by satisfying the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. It uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number and builds the rows of the 2D array by iteratively selecting distinct numbers from the counter. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
