# [1773. Count Items Matching a Rule](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-items-matching-a-rule/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the `ith` item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `ith` item is said to match the rule if **one** of the following is true:

- `ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == typei`.
- `ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == colori`.
- `ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == namei`.

Return *the number of items that match the given rule*.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.
```


## Constraints:

- `1 <= items.length <= 104`
- `1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10`
- `ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.
- All strings consist only of lowercase letters.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def countMatches(self, items: List[List[str]], ruleKey: str, ruleValue: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for type_, color, name in items:
            if ruleKey == "type" and type_ == ruleValue:
                count += 1
            elif ruleKey == "color" and color == ruleValue:
                count += 1
            elif ruleKey == "name" and name == ruleValue:
                count += 1
        return count
```

The given solution counts the number of items that match the given rule by iterating through the `items` array and comparing the values of `type`, `color`, and `name` with the `ruleValue` based on the `ruleKey`.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a count variable to 0.
2. Iterate through each item in the `items` array.
3. For each item, compare the value of `ruleKey` with the corresponding value (`type`, `color`, or `name`) of the item:
   - If `ruleKey` is "type" and the value matches `ruleValue`, increment the count by 1.
   - If `ruleKey` is "color" and the value matches `ruleValue`, increment the count by 1.
   - If `ruleKey` is "name" and the value matches `ruleValue`, increment the count by 1.
4. Return the count, which represents the number of items that match the given rule.

The algorithm compares the values of `type`, `color`, and `name` with `ruleValue` based on the value of `ruleKey` and increments the count if there is a match.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `items` array. The algorithm iterates through each item in the `items` array once and performs constant-time operations at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the count variable.

#### Summary

The given solution counts the number of items that match the given rule by comparing the values of `type`, `color`, and `name` with `ruleValue` based on `ruleKey`. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
