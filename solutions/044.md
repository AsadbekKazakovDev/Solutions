# [1669. Merge In Between Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-in-between-linked-lists/description/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given two linked lists: `list1` and `list2` of sizes `n` and `m` respectively.
Remove `list1`'s nodes from the `ath` node to the `bth` node, and put `list2` in their place.
The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:

*Build the result list and return its head.*

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
Output: [0,1,2,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.

```

## Constraints:

- `3 <= list1.length <= 104`
- `1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1`
- `1 <= list2.length <= 104`


## O(n+m) solution

### Name of solution 

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeInBetween(self, list1: ListNode, a: int, b: int, list2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        node = list1
        for _ in range(a-1):
            node = node.next

        temp = node
        for _ in range(a, b+1):
            node = node.next

        temp.next = list2
        while temp.next:
            temp = temp.next

        temp.next = node.next
        return list1
```

The given solution uses a two-step approach to perform the required node replacement in `list1`.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Traverse `list1` until the node before the `a`th node, i.e., `a-1` iterations. Set the current node as `temp`.
2. Traverse `list1` from the `a`th node to the `b`th node, i.e., `b-a+1` iterations. Set the current node as `node`.
3. Update `temp.next` to point to `list2`. Traverse `list2` until the last node and set `temp` as the last node.
4. Update `temp.next` to point to the node after the `b`th node.
5. Finally, return `list1` with the replaced nodes.

**Analysis of Time and Space Complexity**

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `list1` and `m` is the length of `list2`. The algorithm performs two traversals: one to reach the `a-1`th node in `list1` and another to traverse `list2` to reach its last node. Both traversals take O(n) and O(m) time, respectively.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) since it only uses a constant amount of extra space for the `temp` and `node` pointers.

**Summary**

The given solution replaces a portion of nodes in `list1` with `list2` by traversing the linked lists and updating the necessary pointers. It has a time complexity of O(n + m) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
