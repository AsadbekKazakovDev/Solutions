# [2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-distinct-integers-after-reverse-operations/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle: Medium

You are given an array `nums` consisting of **positive** integers.

You have to take each integer in the array, **reverse its digits**, and add it to the end of the array. You should apply this operation to the original integers in `nums`.

Return the number of **distinct** integers in the final array.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [1,13,10,12,31]
Output: 6
Explanation: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [1,13,10,12,31,1,31,1,21,13].
The reversed integers that were added to the end of the array are underlined. Note that for the integer 10, after reversing it, it becomes 01 which is just 1.
The number of distinct integers in this array is 6 (The numbers 1, 10, 12, 13, 21, and 31).
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After including the reverse of each number, the resulting array is [2,2,2,2,2,2].
The number of distinct integers in this array is 1 (The number 2).
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution 

#### Python3

```python
class Solution:
    def countDistinctIntegers(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        def reverse(number):
            result = 0
            while number:
                result = result * 10 + number % 10
                number //= 10
            return result

        for num in nums[:]:
            nums.append(reverse(num))
            
        return len(set(nums))
```

The given solution solves the problem by iterating through each number in the `nums` array, reversing its digits, and appending the reversed number to the end of the array. It then returns the count of distinct integers in the final array.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Define a helper function `reverse` that takes a number as input and reverses its digits. This function uses a variable `result` initialized to 0.
2. Inside the `reverse` function, enter a while loop that continues as long as the input number is non-zero.
3. Inside the while loop, calculate the next digit of the reversed number by using the expression `result = result * 10 + number % 10`, where `number % 10` gives the last digit of the number and `result * 10` shifts the existing digits to the left.
4. Divide the input number by 10 using the floor division operator `number //= 10` to remove the last digit.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the input number becomes zero.
6. After defining the `reverse` function, iterate through each number `num` in the `nums` array using a for loop.
7. Inside the for loop, append the reversed number `reverse(num)` to the `nums` array using the `append` method.
8. Finally, return the length of the set of distinct integers in the `nums` array using the `len` and `set` functions.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(N * D), where N is the length of the `nums` array and D is the maximum number of digits in the input numbers. This is because the algorithm iterates through each number in the array and reverses its digits, which takes O(D) time.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array. This is because the algorithm uses additional space to store the reversed numbers in the `nums` array.

#### Summary

The given solution calculates the number of distinct integers in an array by reversing the digits of each number and appending the reversed number to the end of the array. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(N * D) and a space complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the array.
