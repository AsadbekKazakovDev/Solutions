# [2657.Â Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays/description/)

**Difficulty:** ğŸŸ¡Â Medium

You are given twoÂ **0-indexed**Â integerÂ ****permutationsÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`Â of lengthÂ `n`.

AÂ **prefix common array**Â ofÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`Â is an arrayÂ `C`Â such thatÂ `C[i]`Â is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the indexÂ `i`Â in bothÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`.

ReturnÂ *theÂ **prefix common array**Â of*Â `A`Â *and*Â `B`.

A sequence ofÂ `n`Â integers is called aÂ **permutation**Â if it contains all integers fromÂ `1`Â toÂ `n`Â exactly once.

## Example:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.

```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50`
- `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n`
- `It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

The algorithm aims to find the prefix common array between two given permutations, `A` and `B`. Here's an analysis of the algorithm's time and space complexity, considering the given constraints:

1. **Initializing Variables**: The algorithm initializes several variables: `length` to store the length of the permutations, `n` to store the maximum value in `A`, `count` to keep track of the prefix common count, `C` to store the prefix common array, and `counter` to track the occurrences of numbers. The initialization of these variables takes constant time and space complexity.

2. **Calculating Prefix Common Array**: The algorithm iterates over the permutations `A` and `B` using the `zip` function. For each pair of elements `a` and `b`, it checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it increments the `count` by 1. Otherwise, it updates the `counter` for both `a` and `b` by incrementing their respective counts. It also increments the `count` by 1 if the count for either `a` or `b` is 2 (indicating it is the second occurrence). Finally, it appends the current `count` to the `C` array. Each iteration in this step has a constant time complexity.

3. **Returning Result**: Finally, the algorithm returns the prefix common array `C`, which requires constant time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the permutations `A` and `B`.

In terms of space complexity, the algorithm utilizes additional memory for the `C` array, which has a size equal to the length of the permutations. Additionally, it uses the `counter` array to track the occurrences of numbers, which has a size of n+1. Therefore, the space complexity is O(n).

To summarize:
- Time complexity: O(n) - Linear time complexity, where n is the length of the permutations `A` and `B`.
- Space complexity: O(n) - Linear space complexity, where n is the length of the permutations `A` and `B`.

The algorithm efficiently calculates the prefix common array by iterating over the permutations and updating the `count` and `counter` based on the elements encountered. It utilizes constant time operations for comparisons and updates, resulting in an efficient solution. The algorithm's performance remains within the given constraints, ensuring efficient computation for permutations of moderate length.

```python3
class Solution:
    def findThePrefixCommonArray(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length, n, count = len(A), max(A), 0
        C, counter = [], [0] * (n+1)
        for a, b in zip(A, B):
            if a == b:
                count += 1
            else:
                counter[a] += 1
                counter[b] += 1
                count += (counter[a] == 2) + (counter[b] == 2)
            C.append(count)
        return C
```
