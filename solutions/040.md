# [2657.Â Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays/)

**Difficulty:** ðŸŸ¡Â Medium

You are given twoÂ **0-indexed**Â integerÂ permutationsÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`Â of lengthÂ `n`.

AÂ **prefix common array**Â ofÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`Â is an arrayÂ `C`Â such thatÂ `C[i]`Â is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the indexÂ `i`Â in bothÂ `A`Â andÂ `B`.

ReturnÂ *theÂ **prefix common array**Â of*Â `A`Â *and*Â `B`.

A sequence ofÂ `n`Â integers is called aÂ **permutation**Â if it contains all integers fromÂ `1`Â toÂ `n`Â exactly once.

## Example:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [1,3,2,4], B = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [0,2,3,4]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: 1 and 3 are common in A and B, so C[1] = 2.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.
At i = 3: 1, 2, 3, and 4 are common in A and B, so C[3] = 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [2,3,1], B = [3,1,2]
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation: At i = 0: no number is common, so C[0] = 0.
At i = 1: only 3 is common in A and B, so C[1] = 1.
At i = 2: 1, 2, and 3 are common in A and B, so C[2] = 3.

```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= A.length == B.length == n <= 50`
- `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= n`
- `It is guaranteed that A and B are both a permutation of n integers.`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def findThePrefixCommonArray(self, A: List[int], B: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        length, n, count = len(A), max(A), 0
        C, counter = [], [0] * (n+1)
        for a, b in zip(A, B):
            if a == b:
                count += 1
            else:
                counter[a] += 1
                counter[b] += 1
                count += (counter[a] == 2) + (counter[b] == 2)
            C.append(count)
        return C
```

The given solution calculates the prefix common array, C, by comparing the values in A and B and tracking the counts using a counter array.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize length as the length of A (which is equal to B), n as the maximum value in A, count as 0, and C as an empty array.
2. Initialize a counter array, counter, of size n+1 with all elements set to 0. The counter array will track the counts of the numbers.
3. Iterate through A and B simultaneously using the zip function:
   - If the values at the current index are equal in A and B, increment the count by 1.
   - Otherwise, increment the count for the values in A and B using the counter array. Update the count by checking if the count for any value in the counter array becomes 2.
   - Append the updated count to the C array.
4. Return the prefix common array, C.

The algorithm compares the values at each index of A and B and updates the count accordingly, maintaining the prefix common array.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of A (which is equal to B). The algorithm iterates through the arrays A and B once, performing constant-time operations at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space for the C array and the counter array, both of size n.

#### Summary

The given solution calculates the prefix common array, C, by comparing the values in two permutations, A and B. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
