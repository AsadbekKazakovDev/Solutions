# [2520. Count the Digits That Divide a Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-digits-that-divide-a-number/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an integer `num`, return the number of digits in `num` that divide `num`.

An integer `val` divides nums if `nums % val == 0`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: num = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: 7 divides itself, hence the answer is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: num = 121
Output: 2
Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: num = 1248
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
```

## Constraints:
- `1 <= num <= 109` 
- `num` does not contain `0` as one of its digits.


## Solutions

### O(log n) solution

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def countDigits(self, num: int) -> int:
        original, total = num, 0
        while num:
            n = num % 10
            total += 0 if original % n else 1
            num //= 10
        return total
```

The given solution solves the problem by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize `original` as `num` and `total` as 0.
2. Iterate through each digit of `num` by dividing `num` by 10 in each iteration until `num` becomes 0.
   - Get the current digit `n` by taking `num % 10`.
   - Check if `original % n == 0`.
     - If true, increment `total` by 1.
     - If false, continue to the next iteration.
   - Divide `num` by 10 to move to the next digit.
3. After the loop ends, return the value of `total` as the count of digits in `num` that divide `num`.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log num) because we iterate through each digit of `num`.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the variables `original`, `total`, and `n`.

#### Summary

The given solution counts the number of digits in `num` that divide `num`. It iterates through each digit of `num` and checks if the digit divides `num`. It maintains a count of such digits and returns the count at the end. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log num) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.
