# [1929. Concatenation of Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans`
of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for 
`0 <= i < n` **(0-indexed)**.

Specifically, `ans` is the **concatenation** of two `nums` arrays.

Return *the array* `ans`.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,1,1,2,1]
Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]]
- ans = [1,2,1,1,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1]
Output: [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
Explanation: The array ans is formed as follows:
- ans = [nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[3]]
- ans = [1,3,2,1,1,3,2,1]
```

## Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def getConcatenation(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            nums.append(nums[i])
        return nums
```

The given solution creates the array `ans` by iterating through each element of the `nums` array and appending it to the end of the same `nums` array. It then returns the resulting array `ans`.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Iterate through each element `num` in the `nums` array.
   - Append `num` to the end of the `nums` array.
2. Return the modified `nums` array, which contains the concatenation of `nums` with itself.

The algorithm appends each element of the `nums` array to the end of the same array, effectively concatenating it with itself.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates through each element of the `nums` array once and performs constant-time operations.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) as it modifies the `nums` array in-place without using any additional space.

#### Summary

The given solution creates the array `ans` by concatenating the input array `nums` with itself. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
