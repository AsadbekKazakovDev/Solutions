# [13. Roman to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```text
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two ones added 
together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27`
is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is 
written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making 
four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`.
There are six instances where subtraction is used:

`I` can be placed before `V` (`5`) and `X` (`10`) to make `4` and `9`. 
`X` can be placed before `L` (`50`) and `C` (`100`) to make `40` and `90`. 
`C` can be placed before `D` (`500`) and `M` (`1000`) to make `400` and `900`.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.

```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
```

## Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

## Solutions

### O(n) solution

#### Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        single = {
            "M": 1000,
            "D": 500,
            "C": 100,
            "L": 50,
            "X": 10,
            "V": 5,
            "I": 1,
        }
        double = {
            "CM": 900,
            "CD": 400,
            "XC": 90,
            "XL": 40,
            "IX": 9,
            "IV": 4,
        }

        index, number, length = 0, 0, len(s)

        while index < length:
            if index + 1 < length and s[index:index+2] in double:
                number += double[s[index:index+2]]
                index += 2
            else:
                number += single[s[index]]
                index += 1
        return number
            
```

The given solution solves the problem by performing the following steps:
1. Create two dictionaries: `single` and `double`. The `single` dictionary maps each single Roman numeral to its corresponding integer value, and the `double` dictionary maps each double Roman numeral (used for subtraction) to its corresponding integer value.
2. Initialize variables `index` and `number` to 0. `index` keeps track of the current index of the Roman numeral string, and `number` stores the final integer value.
3. Iterate through the Roman numeral string while `index` is less than the length of the string:
   - Check if the current index plus 1 is within the length of the string and the substring of length 2 starting from the current index is present in the `double` dictionary.
     - If true, add the corresponding value from the `double` dictionary to `number`.
     - Increment `index` by 2.
   - If the above condition is false, add the value of the single Roman numeral from the `single` dictionary to `number`.
     - Increment `index` by 1.
4. Return the final value of `number`.

#### Complexity Analysis

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string `s`. We iterate through the string once to convert it into its corresponding integer value.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(1) because the dictionaries used for conversion have a fixed number of elements.

#### Summary

The given solution converts a valid Roman numeral `s` into its corresponding integer value. It uses dictionaries to map the Roman numerals to their integer values and applies the rules for subtraction when necessary. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for the given constraints.
