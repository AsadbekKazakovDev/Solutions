# [2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/description/)

**Difficulty:** :yellow_circle:

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an **equal** number of positive and negative integers.

You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

1. Every **consecutive pair** of integers have **opposite signs**.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the **order** in which they were present in `nums` is **preserved**.
3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return *the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the aforementioned conditions*.


## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,-2,-5,2,-4]
Output: [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4]
Explanation:
The positive integers in nums are [3,1,2]. The negative integers are [-2,-5,-4].
The only possible way to rearrange them such that they satisfy all conditions is [3,-2,1,-5,2,-4].
Other ways such as [1,-2,2,-5,3,-4], [3,1,2,-2,-5,-4], [-2,3,-5,1,-4,2] are incorrect because they do not satisfy one or more conditions.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1]
Output: [1,-1]
Explanation:
1 is the only positive integer and -1 the only negative integer in nums.
So nums is rearranged to [1,-1].

```


## Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 105`
- `nums.length` is **even**
- `1 <= |nums[i]| <= 105`
- `nums` consists of **equal** number of positive and negative integers.


## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def rearrangeArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * len(nums)

        i, j = 0, 1
        for num in nums:
            if num > 0:
                result[i] = num
                i += 2
            else:
                result[j] = num
                j += 2

        return result
```

The given solution rearranges the elements of the `nums` array to satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a result array with the same length as the `nums` array, filled with zeros.
2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to 0 and 1, respectively. These pointers will be used to track the positions where positive and negative integers should be placed in the result array.
3. Iterate through each element, `num`, in the `nums` array:
   - If `num` is positive, assign it to the `i`th position in the result array and increment `i` by 2 to maintain the gap between positive integers.
   - If `num` is negative, assign it to the `j`th position in the result array and increment `j` by 2 to maintain the gap between negative integers.
4. Return the result array, which represents the rearranged array satisfying the given conditions.

The algorithm assigns positive integers to even positions (`i`) and negative integers to odd positions (`j`) in the result array, preserving the order of integers with the same sign.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates through each element of the `nums` array once and performs constant-time operations at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space to store the result array, which has the same length as the `nums` array.

#### Summary

The given solution rearranges the elements of the `nums` array to satisfy the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
