# [1720.Â Decode XORed Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-xored-array/description/)

**Difficulty:** ðŸŸ¢Â Easy

There is aÂ **hidden**Â integer arrayÂ `arr`Â that consists ofÂ `n`Â non-negative integers.
It was encoded into another integer arrayÂ `encoded`Â of lengthÂ `n - 1`, such thatÂ `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`. For example, ifÂ `arr = [1,0,2,1]`, thenÂ `encoded = [1,2,3]`.
You are given theÂ `encoded`Â array. You are also given an integerÂ `first`, that is the first element ofÂ `arr`, i.e.Â `arr[0]`.
ReturnÂ *the original array*Â `arr`. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```
Input: encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4
Output: [4,2,0,7,4]

```

## Constraints:

- `2 <= n <= 104`
- `encoded.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= encoded[i] <= 105`
- `0 <= first <= 105`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def decode(self, encoded: List[int], first: int) -> List[int]:
        result = [first]
        for num in encoded:
            first ^= num
            result.append(first)
        return result
```

The given solution decodes the encoded array into the original array using XOR operations. It iterates through the encoded array and applies XOR operations to reconstruct the original array.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Initialize a result array with the first element, `first`, of the original array.
2. Iterate through the encoded array:
   - Apply XOR operation between the current element, `num`, in the encoded array and the previous element in the result array, `first`. Update `first` with the XOR result.
   - Append the updated `first` to the result array.
3. Return the result array, which represents the original array.

By iteratively applying XOR operations between consecutive elements, the algorithm reconstructs the original array.

#### Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the encoded array. The algorithm iterates through the encoded array once and performs constant-time operations at each iteration.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) as it uses additional space to store the result array, which has a length of n.

#### Summary

The given solution decodes the encoded array into the original array using XOR operations. It has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
