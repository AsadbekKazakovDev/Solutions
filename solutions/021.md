# [1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/description/)

**Difficulty:** :green_circle: Easy

There are `n` kids with candies. You are given an integer array `candies`,
where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the i<sup>th</sub> 
kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies 
that you have.

Return a boolean array `result` of length n, where `result[i]` is `true` if, 
after giving the i<sup>th</sup> kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have 
the **greatest** number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.

Note that **multiple** kids can have the **greatest** number of candies.

## Examples:

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true] 
Explanation: If you give all extraCandies to:
- Kid 1, they will have 2 + 3 = 5 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 2, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 3, they will have 5 + 3 = 8 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 4, they will have 1 + 3 = 4 candies, which is not the greatest among the kids.
- Kid 5, they will have 3 + 3 = 6 candies, which is the greatest among the kids.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: candies = [4,2,1,1,2], extraCandies = 1
Output: [true,false,false,false,false] 
Explanation: There is only 1 extra candy.
Kid 1 will always have the greatest number of candies, even if a different kid is given the extra candy.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: candies = [12,1,12], extraCandies = 10
Output: [true,false,true]
```

## Constraints:

- `n == candies.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`


## Solutions

### O(n) solution in Python3

```python3
class Solution:
    def kidsWithCandies(self, candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:
        greatest = max(candies)
        return [extraCandies+candy >= greatest for candy in candies]
```

The given solution determines the greatest number of candies among all the kids by finding the maximum value in the `candies` array. Then, it iterates through each kid and checks whether they can have the greatest number of candies after receiving all the extra candies.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Find the greatest number of candies among all the kids by calculating the maximum value in the `candies` array and store it in the variable `greatest`.
2. Iterate through each kid's candies in the `candies` array:
   - Check if the sum of the kid's current candies and the extra candies is greater than or equal to the `greatest` number of candies.
   - Store the result (`True` or `False`) in the corresponding position of the `result` array.
3. Return the `result` array.

## Analysis of Time and Space Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of kids (length of the `candies` array). The algorithm iterates through the `candies` array once to find the maximum value and once again to determine the results.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of kids (length of the `candies` array). The algorithm creates an additional `result` array to store the results for each kid.

## Summary

The given solution solves the problem by finding the greatest number of candies among all the kids and then determining, for each kid, whether they can have the greatest number of candies after receiving all the extra candies. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), making it an efficient solution for the problem at hand.
